# weather-app

## Description
The Weather Application is designed to consume a Weather API that provides the application with the necessary data to display. Currently it displays up to three days in the forecast but the application is capable of displaying as many days as desired. The application can be viewed in daily, weekly or hourly forecast format. The user can also choose between a “light or dark mode” feature that is saved to the local storage.
